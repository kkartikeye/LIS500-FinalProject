        <h1> Score: 64-79 </h1>
        <br>
        <h3> You have shown to have an understanding of biases in the workplace. Your score is above average, though you may display an underlying bias believing that women of color have more contributions when compared to men in the workplace. Where do you think equality fits in the workplace? How can it make it a better place? It is important to think about how your gender identity and race has shaped this score and how you can implement the idea of equality in the workplace in your everyday life. How can you share this knowledge with others to improve your bias?</h3>

        <h1> Score: 48-63 </h1>
        <br>
        <h3> You have shown to have little understanding of biases in the workplace. Your score is below average, you display an underlying bias and show you may not support working with people from diverse backgrounds or have any knowledge of their contributions. You may believe there is little contribution from women of color in the workplace due to performance and that men contribute more to the workplace. Why do you think this? Think about how your experience and identity have shaped your results from this survey. Acknowledge possibly your rank in the workplace and your contributions, how are these compared to people from different backgrounds? It is important for you to share this knowledge with others in order to hear other people’s experiences to possibly shape your idea around equality in the workplace.</h3>

        <h1> Score: Below 48 </h1>
        <br>
        <h3> Your very low score reflects that you have a profound understanding of biases in the workplace. Though, your score lies on the high-bias level. This means that you make active assumptions and are not supportive of people in the workplace incorporating diversity in your day-to-day life. You have shown to be unsupportive specifically towards women of color and we can suggest you have a bias towards white men in the workplace. It is very important for you to talk to others in an attempt to correct this bias. </h3>
